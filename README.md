# wiki-page
This project will help us learn the basics of **HTML** and **CSS**, as well as how to use these to create a simple webpage.

## Objective
Choose a person/place/thing of your choosing and create an informative wiki page about it! You do not need to write the text yourself, though you're welcome to do so--copy pasting (short) descriptions from another source is okay.

## Setup
1. Create a new HTML/CSS project

The two files we'll be editing are `index.html` and `style.css`.

## HTML
First, go to `index.html` and change the text in the `<title>` tags to fit your wiki page.

Then, in the `body` of the file, add the following:
+ A page header using the `<header>` tag.
+ Either an ordered list or unordered list (either using `ol` or `ul`, respectively)
+ At least two sections of your wiki page (e.g. a 'Description' section or a 'Personal Life' section) using `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, etc.
+ A picture of your wiki subject using the `<img>` tag. Don't forget an `alt` description!
+ Within the `img` tag, give this image an `id` of `wikipic`.
+ At least one hyperlink, using the `<a>` tag and `href` keywords.

Protip: You can use `p` tags to group text into their own paragraphs!

## CSS
Now we move on to styling and decorating the page. Using tags and id attributes:
+ Change the color of the background OR add a background image
+ Change the font of your text
+ Change the color of your links
+ Move your image so that it's placed on the **right** side of the screen, inline with the text. (like Wikipedia!)

## Stretch Goals
Feel free to keep decorating your wiki page! An additional challenge would to be adding a horizontal navigation bar at the top of your page that links to different sections of your article. E.g. there'd be a link to the 'Description' section or 'History' section, etc. Hint: try using a list!
